# Digital-Signal-Processing

## Description:

A general signal manipulation repo detailing techniques I use to process signals in the Julia programming language.

## Contents:

- Sampled Signals, Discrete Fourier Transform, and Matched Filter

- Simulating Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation

## Comments:
The code will be commented on a bit more to enhance understanding of the algorithms used and why they were used the way they were.
